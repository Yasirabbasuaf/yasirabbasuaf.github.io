Hello! I am currently doing a master's in Agricultural Engineering with a major in irrigation and drainage at [University of Agriculture Faisalabad](https://web.uaf.edu.pk/). I completed my bachelor's degree in Agricultural Engineering with a 3.48/ 4.00 CGPA in 2024. I completed an internship on " Fundamentals of Remote Sensing and GIS their application in agriculture" in 2023. Firstly, I collected soil Ec and pH samples. I generate maps on Arc GIS. My chapter is approved for publication in Springer Nature on " Geospatial modeling of groundwater system for sustainable management: A review" in 2025.  I have completed two fellowship programs  Amal fellowship and OMLAS fellowship in 2023.  I participated online in summer school on " School on Strategies for Adapting to and Mitigating the Effects of Climate Change in Agricultural Sector " at Universitat de VicUniversitat Central de Catalunya in 2024. I have completed my bachelor's final year project on the topic " Geospatial modeling for Reconstructing High-Resolution (1Km) Groundwater Quality Data-Scarce Agro- Urbanized Region in Panjab, Pakistan. I have participated in many online courses. I have completed a short course on "Introduction to GIS mapping" from the University of Toronto. I have also participated in the online training " Introduction to Remote Sensing and Hands-on Disaster Management Applications" from the SpaceSuite project funded by the European Union in 2024.
